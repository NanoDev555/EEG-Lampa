# RoboLog

## Introduktion
RoboLog is a robotics project designed to control a Niryo One robot using various sensor inputs like a potentiometer, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), and a flex sensor. The project enables users to control the robot's joints and gripper with smooth motion handling and precise sensor input. The core of the project integrates Arduino and Python code for controlling the robot's movements, with custom thresholds to filter sensor noise for optimal robot performance.

This project is ideal for anyone working on automation, robotics education, or industrial control systems that require accurate movement control based on sensor inputs.

## Prerequisites
Before running the RoboLog project, you need the following:

- Niryo One Robot: A 6-axis robotic arm used for educational or industrial applications.

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense: Used for reading sensor inputs like the IMU and flex sensor.

- Arduino IDE: For compiling and uploading the Arduino code.
- Python 3.x: For running the control scripts.

- Niryo One Python API: A library to communicate with and control the Niryo One robot.

- IMU (Accelerometer): Built-in on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE for detecting joint movements.

- Potentiometer: For manual control of one of the robot's joints.

- Flex Sensor: For controlling the gripper.

- USB cables: To connect Arduino to the computer running the Python code.

- Serial communication: Between Arduino and Python for real-time control.
